# Session 4

In this session, we are going to look at how we can build a shopping car application using JSP's and the Session object.

## Exercise 1. Shopping Cart App
In this exercise we are going to look at how to use the session object to store a unique shopping cart for each user of our application. 
You have been provided with a partially completed project and a series of instructions to build the app. [shoppingcart](../session4/shoppingcart )

Remember you should first copy this folder into your own myPracticeCourseWork folder and do any work there.

## Exercise 2 adding bootstrap

These exercises follow on from [shoppingcart](../session4/shoppingcart ) and use the same shopping cart project you created.

If you had trouble completing the exercises yourself, 
you can still use the session 4 answer project [webApplicationExercise2-answer](../session4/shoppingcart/webApplicationExercise2-answer) as your starting point here

In this exercise we are going to build on our existing shopping cart application to add extra pages and formatting using the bootstrap library.
Later we will be looking at the SpringMVC framework to see how this improves the web design.

You should complete the exercises in [shoppingcart-bootstrap](../session4/shoppingcart-bootstrap)
