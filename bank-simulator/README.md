# Bank Simulator

The project [jpaSpringMvcSimpleBank](../bank-simulator/jpaSpringMvcSimpleBank) contains a simple web application which simulates a bank.
This provides the Credit Card transaction ReST interface to be used in your group and individual projects.

You can run this program locally in netbeans or you can access it on line at the url 

http://com528bank.ukwest.cloudapp.azure.com:8080

The project itself uses all of the technologies you will encounter in this course and you are free to re-use any of it you need in your project. 
Note particularly the web client module which provides a ReST client which is useful to perform credit card transactions.

# Client

To make it easier to encorporate the bank client into your project, there is a seperate [standalone-bankclient](../bank-simulator/standalone-bankclient) project which has all of the dependencies required built into a stand alone module.
