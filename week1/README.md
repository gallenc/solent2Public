# Week 1 Exercises

These exercises will help you appreciate what maven does to help your build.

Before you do anything, you should ensure that you have maven installed and a windows command prompt with the correct class path. 

Open a cmd.exe window and try
```
mvn -version
javac -version
java -version
```
If any of these commands does not work, you do not have the correct maven and java installation on your machine. 
All is not lost since we can do a temporary install using the instructions and script in  [maven-setup](../maven-setup).

If you use [maven-setup](../maven-setup). Keep the command prompt open and CD to the correct folder to use this command prompt to run the build commands in these exercises.

First try the  [command-line-exercise](../week1/command-line-exercise) to help you appreciate what manually compiling and running java code entails.

Then look at the [maven-test-exercise](../week1/maven-test-exercise) to understand what maven does for you.

Finally try the [revisionCOM405](../week1/revisionCOM405).
This exercise will help you revise the final weeks of COM405 Introduction to OOD / Java and introduce UML, Testing and maven.

The answer to this exercise is here [revisionCOM405Answer](../week1/revisionCOM405Answer) but dont look at it until you have tried your own.
