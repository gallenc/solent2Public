# week 1 exercises

These exercises will help you appreciate what maven does to help your build.

Before you do anything, you should ensure that you have maven installed and a windows command prompt with the correct class path. 
See [maven-setup](../maven-setup). Use this command prompt to run the commends in these exercises.

First try the  [command-line-exercise](../week1/command-line-exercise) to help you appreciate what manually compiling and running java code entails.

Then look at the [maven-test-exercise](../week1/maven-test-exercise) to understand what maven does for you.
