# This exercise is adapted from COM 405 Week 10 - Polymorphism

Rather than build a GUI, we will simply create a model and JUNIT tests which test the model

To see the use case look at  [Week_10_PolymorphismOOP.pdf](../revisionCOM405/Week_10_PolymorphismOOP.pdf)

The model has already been created for you and you can see a UML model of it below
![alt text](../revisionCOM405/UMLDiagrams/Class%20Diagrams/classDiagram.png "Figure classDiagram.png")


This UML diagram illustrates the unfinished classes under the /src/main folder You need to implement the functionality for each concrete class ( Car, Lorry, Motorbyke etc) and provide JUNIT tests to test your functions in the /src/test folder. More details of this will be discussed in class.

To remind yourself about polymorphism see  [Week 10 PolymorphismGuidance.pdf](../revisionCOM405/Week_10_PolymorphismGuidance.pdf)
