# Session 1 Exercises

## Java build and test exercises and some Java revision

These exercises will help you appreciate what maven does to help you build a java project.

Before you do anything, you should ensure that you have maven installed correctly and can open a windows command prompt with the correct class path. 


Open a cmd.exe window or a powershell and try
```
mvn -version
javac -version
java -version
```
If any of these commands does not work, you do not have the correct maven and java installation on your machine.
Please go through the seperate instructions to get your machine set up correctly.

( DEPRICATED:
If you are on a university machine which does not have maven installed all is not lost since we can do a temporary install using the instructions and script in  [maven-setup](../maven-setup) 

If you use [maven-setup](../maven-setup). Keep the command prompt open and CD to the correct folder to use this command prompt to run the build commands in these exercises 
).
