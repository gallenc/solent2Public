# Java Web JSP and facade

This week we will begin to look at Java Server Pages Technology and how the services we create last week can be used as a controler service running behind a web page view using very basic JSP.

JSP's contain a mix of HTML and Java elements. 
Usually when you design a JSP, you start of with a raw HTML page, CSS and potentially javascript  which define the look and feel of the page. 
You then add  JSP specific elements which implement the dynamic behaviour.

## Task 1 Build compile and import the project
In order to work with this project, you should first build it using maven
```
cd webfacadeexample1
mvn clean install
```
We are doing the build first so that netbeans has the dependencies already downloaded when it opens the project.

Now you will need to import the poject into Netbeans using 'open existing project'

![alt text](../webfacadeexample1/images/NetbeansOpenProject.png "Figure NetbeansOpenProject.png" )

Remember to click 'open required projects' so that the parent project and its subprojects are all imported.

##  Task 2 Running the project

You can run the project using maven or directly in the Netbeans IDE.
Please note that you can't do both at the same time due to port clashes.
If you do run into problems restart Netbeans.

### To run the project using maven

Maven used the cargo plugin to start an embedded tomcat container.
You must run the following command after your build in the web directory

```
cd web
mvn org.codehaus.cargo:cargo-maven2-plugin:run
```
(make sure you have turned off tomcat in netbeans so that the ports dont clash)

If you open a browser and browse to http://localhost:8080/basicfacadeweb/
you will see the index page of the application.

You can stop the browser using control c (ctrl-c).

Please note that when you run the example this way you will need to rebuild the project and restart tomcat
every time you make changes otherwise the changes will not be packaged in a war and run by tomcat.

### To run the project using  in Netbeans embedded Jetty server

If you right click on the webfacade-example1 project in netbeans and select 'run' netbeans will spin up a tomcat instance and launch your application.

If you are asked for username and password just use the default admin admin.
 
(You must make sure you have stopped any maven started tomcat before you do this.)

You will be able to see the application at http://localhost:8080/basicfacadeweb/

browse to  http://localhost:8080/basicfacadeweb/example2.jsp 
You should see the time generated by the inserted java code line in example1.jsp 
```
<h1>Hello World! <%=new java.util.Date().toString() %></h1>
```
JSPs are translated into java servelets before being compiled and run.
If you have run the application in Netbeans you can view the raw servelet code by right clickng on th JSP and selecting 'vew servelet' You will see a lot of java code surrounding the HTML from the page which is printed out using out.print(" html code ... ") statements.
Normally you dont need to worry about the contents of the servelet but this shows you what is happing to your JSP page under the hood. 

## Task 3 Extend example2.jsp

(Note - this task is already done for you - we did this exercise earlier in the module :) )

See if you can add a form to the example2.jsp so that a user can input a name of an animal and add it to the list.

note the lines
```
    // accessing request parameters
    String animalNameStr = request.getParameter("animalName");
    String animalTypeStr = request.getParameter("animalType");
```
These allow you to access url parameters or POST form parameters which are included in any page request

The following URL http://localhost:8084/basicfacadeweb/example2.jsp?animalType=emue&animalName=Fred

will add emue and fred to the page. You should be able to use this as a starting point for using the facade object to add animals to the farm.

You can use a form to generate such an input. For axample:
```
<form action="./example2.jsp">
  <input type="hidden" name="animalType" value="<%=animalType %>">
  Animal Name:  <input type="text" name="animalName">
  <button type="submit" >create <%=animalType %></button>
</form> 
```

## Task 4 adding extra fields

See if you can add another field for each animal in order to to add the food it eats.

You will need to change the animal model class and test this before adding to the JSP.
