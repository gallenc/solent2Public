## Java build and test exercises and some Java revision

These exercises will help you appreciate what maven does to help your build.

Before you do anything, you should ensure that you have maven installed and a windows command prompt with the correct class path. 

Open a cmd.exe window and try
```
mvn -version
javac -version
java -version
```
If any of these commands does not work, you do not have the correct maven and java installation on your machine.
Please go through the seperate instructions to get your machine set up correctly.

( DEPRICATED:
If you are on a university machine which does not have maven installed all is not lost since we can do a temporary install using the instructions and script in  [maven-setup](../maven-setup) 

If you use [maven-setup](../maven-setup). Keep the command prompt open and CD to the correct folder to use this command prompt to run the build commands in these exercises 
).

First try the  [command-line-exercise](../week1/command-line-exercise) to help you appreciate what manually compiling and running java code entails.

Then look at the [maven-test-exercise](../week1/maven-test-exercise) to understand what maven does for you.

Finally try the [revisionCOM405](../week1/revisionCOM405).
This exercise will help you revise the final weeks of COM405 Introduction to OOD / Java and introduce UML, Testing and maven.

The answer to this exercise is here [revisionCOM405Answer](../week1/revisionCOM405Answer) but dont look at it until you have tried your own.
