## Session 7

In this session, we will be reinforcing some of the concepts of interfaces and classes and Generics in java.
We will also begin looking seriously at java persistence 

## Set up
1. remember to merge your project with the upstream project
2. create a new 'session7' folder under your myPracticeCouseWork folder.
3. copy the contents of session7 into this folder and modify or add to the code here as needed. (NB only change any code in myPracticeCouseWork).

## Exercise 1 Interfaces, Collections and Factory And Facade patterns

In this exercise you will look at Java Collections and Generics, complete a simple factory method and implement and create tests for a simple facade interface. 

You will then look at how to generate skeleton code from UML class diagrams in NetBeans.

Finally, you will look at a more complex example which completely separates the client from the implementation classes.

Try the  [factoryandfacade](../session7/factoryandfacade) exercises.


## Exercise 2 Java persistence

We looked briefly at the concept of a Data Access Object (DAO) in session 5 when we looked at how properties could be persisted in a properties file.

In this exercise we will look at how data could be saved using a DAO implemented in several different ways. 

Try the  [animal-dao-examples](../session7/animal-dao-examples) exercises.

## Exercise 3 More JPA examples

In this exercise we will look at using JPA to persist users and appointments for a doctors surgery.

[jpaExample1](../session7/jpaExample1) 


## Exercise 3 Java persistence and a web application

This example brings together the JPA DAO with a web application so you can see how they work together to save animal items in a database.
