# factoryandfacade3 example

Even more complex example where interfaces and abstract classes are used throughout.

This example is more complex and includes factory methods to create objects by type. 

There are both a simple implementation and a Spring implementation of the object factory.

See if you can add a Duck that quacks to both implementations and their corresponding tests
