# Card Checker
card-checker is a library of classes that you can build and import into your project.
Note that it is imported as a dependency in the card-main project's pom.

The library does three things

1. it calculates lunn check digits
2. it checks that a given credit card number has a correct lunn code
3. it can tell you what sort of card you have; Visa, Mastercard etc

You are NOT to change these classes but write code in your own project which adapts the given library to your needs.
It does most of what you need but you will have to think about how to use it.
look at the test classes to understand how the library works and could be used in your project..
