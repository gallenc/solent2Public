## Abstract Factory
The abstract factory pattern is a design pattern that allows for the creation of groups of related objects without the requirement of specifying the exact concrete classes that will be used. One of a number of factory classes generates the object sets.

The following is a diagram illustrating a simple factory

## Facade Pattern

Facade Pattern: Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. A Facade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

## More advanced Facade Pattern

A more advanced example is provided below which is implemented in the factoryandfacade2 project
